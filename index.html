  <p>The Western Isles Yacht Club is based in Tobermory on the Isle of Mull and our purpose is to promote water-sports. This includes dinghy sailing, coastal rowing, sea swimming, canoeing and, of course, yachting. If you are interested in the <a href="/sailing-cadets/">sailing cadets</a> club for kids or <a href="http://isleofmullcoastalrowing.org">coastal rowing on Mull</a> get in touch to find out about taster sessions. We are also keen to hear from yacht owners on Mull who are keen to join events such as trips to Coll or who would be keen to take part in racing events.</p>

    <h4>Cadets</h4>
 <p>Cadets sessions for kids and young adults are on Wednesday nights in Tobermory bay typically from May to September. You have to be a member of the yacht club and they cost £3 per night for sailing or canoeing. Alternatively you can buy a cadets season pass for £25 which covers all cadets sailing or canoeing sessions for the season. We usually have about 20 sessions between May and September so the season pass is great value for anyone who comes regularly.</p>
