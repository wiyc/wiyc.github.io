The cadets season is starting Wednesday 15th of May this year. You will need to bring a lifejacket or bouyancy aid, a wetsuit, shoes that you don't mind getting wet and ideally thin waterproofs to keep the wind off.

Its also nice if you have a towel ready for when you get out if the weather is a bit driech.

You will need your parents to fill out and sign a [cadets consent form](/images/Cadets%20Consent%20form%202018.pdf) and you will need to abide by the [club code of conduct](/code-of-conduct/)

You also need to be a member of the club if you wish to come to more than one session. Subscription rates are once again unchanged from last year and should be paid online [here](http://webcollect.org.uk/wiyc) 

In addition to this, the cost per session is Â£2 per person, payable on the day.

If you already pay your subscription via a bank standing order, please email the secretary stating your name and/or payment reference and the date on which your standing order is paid.

In all other cases, please visit our new subscription [web page](http://webcollect.org.uk/wiyc).  Act as if you are a new member : click on "Join Here", choose a membership level and enter your details.  You can pay by Direct Debit or Bank Transfer.

By offering online subscriptions, we hope to reduce the amount of admin work required by your volunteer committee, as well as improve our communication with you.

Your subscription is used by the club to pay for insurance and maintenance of our boats and associated equipment (both rowing skiffs, the cadet dinghies and safety boat, radios, etc.).

If you have any queries about this process, or are unsure of your current membership status, please don't hesitate to ask for help.
