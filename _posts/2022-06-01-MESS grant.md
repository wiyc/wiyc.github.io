Massive Thank you to MESS Island Castaways Charity Shops for the donation of Â£400 to enable us to purchase safety equipment for the Western Isles Yachting Club.  This has helped bring our safety boat up to RYA standards & allowed us to buy a waterproof VHF radio and buoyancy aids for our fleet of kayaks.
If you are in Tobermory, on a Wednesday night you will see our Topper Sailing boats and Kayaks out playing in the bay. Thank you MESS Island Castaways Charity Shops!
