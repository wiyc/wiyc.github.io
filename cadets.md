WIYC sailing cadets provides children and teenagers the opportunity to sail toppers, topaz, a laser II and a wayfarer sailing dinghy.

If you or your kids are interested in joining the sailing cadets please [get in touch](/contact/) with the secretary or come along on a Wednesday night to see. Cadets is popular so you may not get in straight away.

If you already have a membership, you can sign up to Cadets sessions by following [this link to the webcollect membership site](https://webcollect.org.uk/wiyc/category/cadets)
